# Matter Kit

The Matter Kit is a framework designed for custom WordPress theme development. Our aim is to make custom theme builds faster by reusing code snippets across projects. This framework is designed for more modern browsers. Most styling and javascript existing will work across IE9+ and recent versions of Chrome and Firefox.

## Documentation

The documentation for the Matter Kit is publicy hosted at: http://kit.mattersolutions.com.au

Code files have comments within them, however we have further notes on our documentation website.

## Dependencies

We're using GruntJS for our dev dependencies and Bower for frontend dependencies. The css part of our framework is written in scss. 

## Contributing

We're currently looking for help with the documentation with the core components and bug reports.

## Bugs and Feature Requests
If you encounter a bug, please send us an email at helpdesk@mattersolutions.com.au and we'll look into it. We aren't currently accepting pull requests.

Feature requests can also be sent to helpdesk@mattersolutions.com.au - we'll take them into consideration. Please note that we're intending to keep the core of this framework light, at least for now. Consider if your request is project-specific, or would be used across many projects.
